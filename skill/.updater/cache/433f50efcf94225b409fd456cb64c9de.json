We may enable it by default again once compatibility improves in the future.\n\n  Additionally, when the environment variable `TERM` is `dumb`, the escape codes are no longer emitted, even if the plugin is enabled.\n\n- [\\#13904](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13904): Fixed the TOML type of the `tmp_path_retention_count` settings in the API reference from number to string.\n\n- [\\#13946](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13946): The private `config.inicfg` attribute was changed in a breaking manner in pytest 9.0.0.\n  Due to its usage in the ecosystem, it is now restored to working order using a compatibility shim.\n  It will be deprecated in pytest 9.1 and removed in pytest 10.\n\n- [\\#13965](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13965): Fixed quadratic-time behavior when handling `unittest` subtests in Python 3.10.\n\n## Improved documentation\n\n- [\\#4492](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4492): The API Reference now contains cross-reference-able documentation of `pytest's command-line flags <command-line-flags>`.\n",
